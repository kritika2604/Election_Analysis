# Election_Analysis
 using Python

# Project Overview
To submit the election audit results to the election commission for a recent congressional election
1. Calculate the total number of votes
2. Get a list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes received by each candidate
4. Calculate the percentage of votes received by each candidate
5. Determine the winning candidate based on popular votes
6. The voter turnout for each county
7. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
8. The county with the highest turnout

# Challenge Overview
In this challenge, using python and visual studio code an election result analysis was done. This included reading the results from a ".csv" file and ending with printing/storing results on a ".txt" file.  For the calculations, various mathematical operations were done along with decision statements, logical operations for complex comparisons, and repetition statements to run code more than once.

# Challenge Summary 
The winning candidate along with the county with most votes turnout was found.
